### Notes
I think the main challenge was trying to go through the tutotials and understand how to function each part. 
My xcode was not updated originally, which I learned about after Lab 1, which caused some problems when running the project.
I was having some trouble with github not commiting to the master branch, but I eventually figured it out.
