### Notes
The main challenge was trying to make sure each step was done correctly before moving on to the next step, specifically for the designing portion. Spacing was a big component, so it was crucial to figure out the math and functions required to accurately create a good interface.

### Notes
I think the main challenge was trying to go through the tutorials and understand how to function each part. 
My xcode was not updated originally, which I learned about after Lab 1, which caused some problems when running the project.
I was having some trouble with github not commiting to the master branch, but I eventually figured it out.
